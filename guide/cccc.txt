b:T5dc,CCCC CARING, COMMUNICATIONS, CONSENT, CAUTION

1. Caring is first because if you care for someone, genuinely care for someone, then you will look out for their best interest. You want to learn about their history, hobbies, interests, dreams, aspirations and their quirks. You listen and pay attention to their needs, injuries, limits and conditions in a scene. You look at that person with care and love, which is something the other person can feel. Care builds trust between two playmates or partners and that trust is the foundation to a scene and to a relationship.

2. Consent. BDSM is not your everyday activities and most often it involves two or more people. Hence it is important that everyone involved agrees to be part of it. Some resistance, edge or 'consensual noncensent' plays may require actual consent forms signed before a scene. Regardless, there must be verbal or written consent before playing out a scene.

3. Communication is fundamental to BDSM. It involves negotiating a scene between playmates, learning about one another, relationship building, receiving feedbacks during and after a scene and etc. Being a good communicator is integral to a stable relationship, whether vanilla or BDSM. Lack of communication may break a vanilla relationship; lack of communication in a BDSM scene or relationship can cause severe injuries. There is no such thing as over-communicated, so talk it out.

4.Caution : be aware of the risk, of the possibility of a danger and act with caution.2:[null,["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":[["$","head",null,{"children":[["$","title",null,{"children":"BDSM Profile"}],["$","meta",null,{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","body",null,{"children":["$","$L4",null,{"children":["$","$L5",null,{"maxWidth":"xs","sx":{"display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","minHeight":"100vh","backgroundColor":"#ede7f6"},"children":["$","$L6",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children"],"loading":"$undefined","loadingStyles":"$undefined","hasLoading":false,"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","template":["$","$L7",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","notFound":[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":"404"}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],"notFoundStyles":[],"childProp":{"current":["$","$L6",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","guide","children"],"loading":"$undefined","loadingStyles":"$undefined","hasLoading":false,"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","template":["$","$L7",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined","childProp":{"current":["$","$L6",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","guide","children","cccc","children"],"loading":"$undefined","loadingStyles":"$undefined","hasLoading":false,"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","template":["$","$L7",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined","childProp":{"current":["$L8",[["$","$L9",null,{"variant":"h3","sx":{"textAlign":"center"},"children":"CCCC"}],["$","$La",null,{"sx":{"mt":"auto"},"fullWidth":true,"orientation":"vertical","aria-label":"bottom button group","children":[["$","$L9",null,{"children":"$b"}],["$","$La",null,{"variant":"outlined","aria-label":"bottom button group","fullWidth":true,"sx":{"mt":"auto","backgroundColor":"#d1c4e9"},"children":["$","$Lc",null,{"component":"$d","href":"/guide","children":"Back"}]}]]}],"$undefined"],null],"segment":"__PAGE__"},"styles":[]}],"segment":"cccc"},"styles":[]}],"segment":"guide"},"styles":[]}]}]}]}]]}],null]
