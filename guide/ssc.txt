a:T870,Safe, Sane and Consensual.

These are some of the bedrock principals of bdsm. Someone not engaged in the BDSM lifestyle may look at BDSM and wonder how "safe, sane, and consensual" enters into the picture as they may see BDSM as unsafe or unhealthy according to misconceptions about the lifestyle

First what is safe?

The common dictionary states that safe is to be "secure from liability to harm, injury, danger, or risk". Safety in BDSM is taking care of their partner so that no matter how intense the scene may be, no injury or transfer of danger disease occurs; that all precautions have been taken to minimize potential dangers. This means doing the research and being knowledgeable about what your engaging in to protect your partner as well as yourself. In order to be safe you must know the risks of BDSM and which activities add spice without causing permanent or lasting damage to the emotional, mental, or physical state of either player. Before engaging in any BDSM, there should alway be a discussion of everything from roles of each person to limits, both hard and soft. From medical issues to safety measures, and all precautions should be set in place if needed.

Remember Nobody wants an embarrassing visit to the emergency room or to have to call the fire department.


Sane

this means that people involved act responsibly and exercise good judgement. The ability to engage in appropriate self control is a big part of the "sane" portion of this philosophy. If you cannot control yourself, you should not enter into a situation where power exchange is a key aspect. An important part of this piece is that BDSM should not be used as a solution for serious psychological conditions or mental health concerns.

Consent

Consent occurs when everyone involved voluntarily agrees to the proposal or desires of another. Consent means a person is free of any tyoe of impared judgement being from alcohol, drugs, mental defect, or other types of imparement which would invalidate the consent. The point of BDSM is that there is some exchange of power, and if it is not agreed upon, it is not BDSM. If there is no consent, it is abuse in some form.2:[null,["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":[["$","head",null,{"children":[["$","title",null,{"children":"BDSM Profile"}],["$","meta",null,{"name":"viewport","content":"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}]]}],["$","body",null,{"children":["$","$L4",null,{"children":["$","$L5",null,{"maxWidth":"xs","sx":{"display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","minHeight":"100vh","backgroundColor":"#ede7f6"},"children":["$","$L6",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children"],"loading":"$undefined","loadingStyles":"$undefined","hasLoading":false,"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","template":["$","$L7",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","notFound":[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":"404"}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],"notFoundStyles":[],"childProp":{"current":["$","$L6",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","guide","children"],"loading":"$undefined","loadingStyles":"$undefined","hasLoading":false,"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","template":["$","$L7",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined","childProp":{"current":["$","$L6",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","guide","children","ssc","children"],"loading":"$undefined","loadingStyles":"$undefined","hasLoading":false,"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","template":["$","$L7",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined","childProp":{"current":["$L8",[["$","$L9",null,{"variant":"h3","sx":{"textAlign":"center"},"children":"SSC"}],["$","$L9",null,{"children":"$a"}],["$","$Lb",null,{"variant":"outlined","aria-label":"bottom button group","fullWidth":true,"sx":{"mt":"auto","backgroundColor":"#d1c4e9"},"children":[["$","$Lc",null,{"component":"$d","href":"/guide","children":"Back"}],"$undefined",["$","$Lc",null,{"component":"$d","href":"/guide/rack","children":"RACK"}]]}]],null],"segment":"__PAGE__"},"styles":[]}],"segment":"ssc"},"styles":[]}],"segment":"guide"},"styles":[]}]}]}]}]]}],null]
